Resource Contents:
-- This resource provides 3 different shell types (01, 02, 03), each available in two variants:
-- 1. Empty: Unfurnished interior shells
-- 2. Furnished: Fully decorated interior shells
-- These can be used as a base for custom interiors in FiveM servers.

-- Usage:
-- Place this resource in your server's resources folder and ensure it's started in your server.cfg file.
-- The shell interiors can then be spawned or used within other scripts that require custom interiors.
